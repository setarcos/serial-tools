A Serial Port Logging and Debugging Tools Based on QT 5.1
============

The original idea comes from the uartassistant example from QextSerialPort project. 
(http://code.google.com/p/qextserialport/)

The uartassistant example uses QextSerialPort as the serial driver, and I changed it
to use the newly introduced QSerialPort in Qt 5.1. So you need at least Qt 5.1 to
compile the code.
